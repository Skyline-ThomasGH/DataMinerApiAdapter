# DataMiner API Adapter

This is an example project that sets up a connection to DataMiner and exposes an HTTP GET call to retrieve 'Job' DOM instances.
It also contains a brief example of how a subscription could be set up.
Note that this is a rough example with many best practises ignored. (DI, error handling, disconnect recovery,...)
